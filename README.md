# OpenCV-FRC-Replica
Recreation of FRC team 217 vision processing code in the 2016 season. Correctly identifies retroreflective tape and through the use of thresholding identifies the closest contour(high goal) and gives its coordinates. These values are then piped to networktables so a robot can PID to a scoring orientation.
